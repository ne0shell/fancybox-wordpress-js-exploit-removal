If your WordPress users are suddenly experiencing redirects to external malware websites, please read this first:

Python script that will scan all WordPress installations on a single host, check if any of them have been compromised by the fancybox-for-wordpress plugin and remove the row that's causing problems.



Setting parameter verbose to 'True' will output all WordPress installations that have this plugin installed. Versions 3.0.3 and below are vulnerable to this attack and should be updated as soon as possible: https://wordpress.org/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/

## Running the script

```
$ chmod +x fancyClean.py
$ ./fancyClean.py
```
