This script will scan all WordPress installations on your host, check if any of them have been compromised by the fancybox-for-wordpress plugin exploit and remove the rows that are causing problems.

## Usage

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
$ chmod +x fancyClean.py
$ ./fancyClean.py
```

If any of your WP databases are using **non-standard table prefixes** (e.g. foo_options instead of wp_options), please include them in **dbExtras dictionary object**.

Please note! Setting parameter verbose to 'True' will output all WordPress installations that have this plugin installed. Versions 3.0.3 and below are vulnerable to this attack and should be updated as soon as possible: https://wordpress.org/plugins/fancybox-for-wordpress/
